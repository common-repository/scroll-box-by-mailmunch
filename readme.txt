The #1 Scroll Box plugin to get email subscribers. Add your sign-up forms in conversion boosting boxes that slide up as a user scrolls.

== Description ==

= Scroll Boxes =

> Scroll Boxes are boxes that slide in as a visitor scrolls down and engages with your site. The visitors that scroll down far enough have engaged with your content and are more likely to subscribe. Having a box slide-in is a sure way to get their attention while staying relatively unobtrusive and less annoying than a pop-up.
